# 2026-02-17

- **Morning Sync:** Yer joined from the machine. Fixed "device token mismatch" using `openclaw doctor --repair`.
- **Workflow Upgrade (v2.0):** 
    - Moved `smart-routing` skill from workspace to official `~/.openclaw/skills/` directory.
    - Implemented **Automatic Failure Escapes** (Self-Healing) to retry failed sub-tasks on fallback models.
    - Implemented **Surgical Context Injection** to selectively give sub-agents persona/project context for creative tasks.
    - Implemented **Automated Synthesis** to unify multi-agent outputs.
    - Implemented **Smart Batching** to bundle light tasks into single agents.
    - Implemented **Quota-Aware Throttling** (via `HEARTBEAT.md` + state file) to skip models at >90% usage.
- **Parallel Fleet Test:** Successfully ran first 3-agent parallel fleet test (Research, Audit, Memory Analysis).
- **Stability Protocol:** Created `STABILITY.md` and updated `AGENTS.md` to prevent "self-lockout" scenarios like the failed sandboxing attempt reported by Yer. Implemented a "Recovery Plan" requirement for all infrastructure changes.
- **Versioning Setup:** Initialized git repository for the workspace. Established a protocol to commit state before making infrastructure changes. 
- **Privacy Protection:** Added `.gitignore` to ensure `.openclaw/` (containing config and tokens) is never pushed to a remote repository.
- **Tooling:** Installed GitHub CLI (`gh`) locally in `~/bin/` to manage remote versioning.
- **System Maintenance:** 
    - Executed full system shutdown last night as requested.
    - Successfully updated OpenClaw from `2026.2.14` to `2026.2.15`.
- **UI Research:** Confirmed browser dashboard (Control UI) currently only supports image attachments via paste; other files must be moved manually to the workspace.
