## 🏗️ The Pillars

### 1. Stability & Safety (The Foundation)
- [x] **Stability Protocol:** Created `STABILITY.md` to prevent self-destruction.
- [x] **Offline Safeguard:** Added mandatory "Ask first" rule for gateway restarts.
- [ ] **Security Hardening:** Resolve CRITICAL audit warning regarding small model web access.
- [ ] **Recovery Drills:** Test manual config rollback from GitHub.

### 2. Continuity & Memory (The Brain)
- [x] **Daily Logs:** Consistent usage of `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`.
- [x] **Memory Flush:** Enabled automatic context preservation before compaction.
- [ ] **Optimize context management for responsiveness:** Implement efficient manual pruning / auto-compaction triggers.
- [ ] **Curated Wisdom:** Initialize `MEMORY.md` to distill long-term patterns and preferences.
- [ ] **Smart Synthesis:** Automate the end-of-day summary to `MEMORY.md`.

### 3. Versioning & Sync (The Safety Net)
- [x] **Git Initialization:** Local workspace versioned.
- [x] **GitHub Integration:** Private remote repository (`lyyer/fraidy-ly`) linked and synced.
- [x] **Privacy Guard:** `.gitignore` active to protect secrets/config.
- [x] **Tooling:** GitHub CLI (`gh`) installed and authenticated.

### 4. Workflow 2.0 (The Engine)
- [x] **Parallel Fleet Test:** Successfully ran 3-agent parallel test.
- [x] **Smart Routing:** Initial setup of `smart-routing` skill.
- [ ] **Quota Awareness:** Implement automated usage tracking for model selection.
- [ ] **Cost Efficiency:** Fine-tune model selection for specific task complexities.
