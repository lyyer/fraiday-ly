## Session Notes
- First real session with Yer
- Set emoji to 🤖
- Updated USER.md with name (Yer) and timezone (America/Chicago)
- Discussed cost optimization — Yer concerned about token costs ($0.32 for basic conversation)
- Added model allowlist to openclaw.json: Sonnet, Haiku, Groq Llama 8B, Groq Llama 70B
- Gateway had auth issues — couldn't use gateway tool, edited config file directly

## Lessons Learned
- **ALWAYS create backups before editing config/important files** (e.g., `cp file file.bak`)
- Yer explicitly requested this as a rule

## Yer's Preferences
- Cost-conscious — wants to minimize API spend
- Direct communicator — doesn't want fluff
- Wants backups before file edits
