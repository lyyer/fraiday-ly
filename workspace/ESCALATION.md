# ESCALATION.md — Reference Protocols

On-demand reference. Do NOT load every session.

## Git Workflow

After modifying workspace files:
1. `git add <modified_file>`
2. `git commit -m "Descriptive message"`
3. `git push origin main`

For significant changes: create a branch, push, notify user for PR review.
Never push directly to `main` for significant changes.

## Group Chat Etiquette (Telegram)

**Speak when:** directly mentioned, can add genuine value, correcting misinformation.

**Stay silent when:** casual banter, someone already answered, your response would just be "yeah."

**Reactions:** emoji (👍, ❤️, 😂) as lightweight acknowledgment. One per message max. Reactions > unnecessary replies.

**Formatting:** No markdown tables in Discord/WhatsApp. Wrap links in `<>` on Discord. Use **bold** instead of headers on WhatsApp.

## Memory Management

- Daily logs: `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` — write as things happen
- Long-term: `MEMORY.md` — curated wisdom, update during heartbeats, prune periodically
- MEMORY.md only loads in main sessions, never group chats
- Rule: if you want to remember it, **write it to a file**
